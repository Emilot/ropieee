# RoPieee

RoPieee is an image for the Raspberry Pi devices (2 and 3) that runs the RoonBridge software from Roon.
This makes the RoPieee a cheap Roon endpoint. 

Although RoPieee is based on Linux it requires no knowledge what so ever to manage it. RoPieee runs for USB-based DAC's out of the box,
and for other connections it can be configured from a web interface.
